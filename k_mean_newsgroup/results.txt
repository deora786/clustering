The experiment was done on 20newsgroup data.

clustering was done using k-mean and tf-idf

Purpose was to see if we can find out right number of clusters we should have.

Plot using Silhouette Coefficient was somewhat giving some intution about number of clusters,
but the result was not as much clear (8-9, 19-21, 24-25)

As the number of clusters increased the score became less informative

The inertia (squered distence from centroid) was also not a good measure as the elbow was not clearly visible, And the inertia decreased almost linearly with number of clusters
